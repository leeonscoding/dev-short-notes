* Don't put too much logic in templates because of maintainability and code duplication.
```html
<script setup>
  import { reactive } from 'vue'

  const author = reactive({
    name: 'John Doe',
    books: [
      'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
      'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
      'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
    ]
  })
</script>

<template>
    <p>{{ author.books.length > 0 ? 'yes' : 'no' }}</p>
</template>
```

* Use computed property for complex logic which has reactive data.
```html
<script setup>
  import { computed, reactive } from 'vue'

  const author = reactive({
    name: 'John Doe',
    books: [
      'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
      'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
      'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
    ]
  })

  const msg = computed(() => author.books.length > 0 ? 'yes' : 'no')
</script>

<template>
    <p>{{ msg }}</p>
</template>
```

* The computed() expects to be passed a *getter function* and the returned value is a *computed ref*. If we want to access the computed ref inside script, the we have to use .value. Here msg.value

* If anything muteted/changed in computed properties dependency, the computed property will also be updated automatically. Here, if any changes occured in author.books then msg will automatically gets the update.

## Computed vs methods
We can achieve the same result by invoking a method
```html
<script setup>
  import { computed, reactive } from 'vue'

  const author = reactive({
    name: 'John Doe',
    books: [
      'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
      'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
      'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
    ]
  })

  const msg = () => author.books.length > 0 ? 'yes' : 'no'
</script>

<template>
    <p>{{ msg() }}</p>
</template>
```
Both will do the same. However computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. Computed properties are only re-evaluted when some of its dependencies are changed.

In comparison, a method invocation will always run the function when a re-render happens.

even if this below code, the computed property will not updated, because `Date.now()` isn't a reactive dependency.

```javascript
const now = computed(() => Date.now())
```

## Writable computed
computed properties are by default getter only. But if need setter then
```html
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'

const firstName = ref('John')
const lastName = ref('Doe')

const fullName = computed({
  get() {
    return firstName.value + ' ' + lastName.value
  },
  set(newValue) {
    [firstName.value, lastName.value] = newValue.split(' ')
  }
})
</script>
<template>
    <p>{{ fullName }}</p>
</template>
```

## Best practices
* computed getter functions should only pure computation and there should be no side effect. For example, 
    * don't mutate other state
    * don't make async request
    * don't mutate a DOM
* Avoid mutating a computed value
