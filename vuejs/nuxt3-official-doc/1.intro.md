* Sends a fully rendered html page to the browser. This makes faster initial load time and better SEO.
* Reduces amount of js to be downloaded in client side. So, better performance in low-powered device.
* pages can be cached in service side.
* Nuxt server engine: Nitro. In dev it used rollup and nodejs workers. It also generates server api and middlewares. In prod, it builds the app in the .output folder. It is minified and no nodejs modules in there(except polyfills).
* Nuxt uses Vite for hot module replacement in dev
* Bundlers: vite/webpack
