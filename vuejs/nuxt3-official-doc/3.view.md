## app.vue
By default Nuxt treat app.vue as the entrypoint and render its content in every route of the app.

## Components
components are reusable pieces of the user interface like buttons, menus etc. Create component in the `component` directory. Then they will automatically available, no need to import.

* Create the directory: `components` in root
* Create RedButton.vue file
```html
<script setup>
</script>

<template>
    <button class="btn-red">Red button</button>
</template>

<style>
    .btn-red {
        background-color: 'red';
        color: 'white';
    }
</style>
```

* In app.vue call by the following
```html
<template>
  <div>
    <RedButton />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Pages
Pages represent views for each specific route pattern. Every file in the `pages/` directory represents a different route displaying its content.

* Create the directory `pages/` in the root directory.
* Create 2 pages in the `pages/` directory. For example, about.vue, index.vue
* remove app.vue, because we have index.vue. It
```html
<template>
    <p>this is index.vue</p>
</template>
```

```html
<template>
    <p>this is about.vue</p>
</template>
```

## Layouts
layouts are wrappers around pages that contain a common user interface for several pages such as a header and footer display.
* create the `layouts/` folder
* entrypoint is default.vue
* need `<slot/>` to display the page content
* if only one layout in the app, then recommonded is app.vue with `<NuxtPage />`
