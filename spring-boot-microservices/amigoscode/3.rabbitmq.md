# Message Brokers
Messge brokers receive messages from publishers/producers and route them to consumers

# AMQP
advanced message queuing protocol. Its a network protocol.

# RabbitMQ steps
* First messages comes to the exchange.
* Then this exchange forwards the messages based on routing pattern. The binding between the exchange and the queue is based on this routing pattern. We can attach multiple queues in an exchange. Also, we can keep multiple exchange.

# Exchange types
* Direct - exchange forward to the exact matches using routing-keys
* fanout - forward to all queues
* topic - forward to all the queues where routing keys are partially matched
* headers - match header instead of routing keys
* nameless - where routing-key=queue name

# Configuration in spring boot
## application.yaml
```yaml
rabbitmq:
    exchanges:
        internal: internal.exchange
    queues:
        notification: noti.queue
    routing-keys:
        internal-notification: internal.noti.routing-key
```

## Configure producer
```java
@Component
public class MessageProducer {
    private final AmqpTemplate template;

    public MessageProducer(AmqpTemplate template) {
        this.template = template;
    }

    public void publish(Object payload, String exchange, String routingKey) {
        template.convertAndSend(exchange, routingKey, payload);
    }
}
```

## Zipkin config
In the docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin
    container_name: zipkin
    ports:
        - "9411:9411"
```

## rabbitmq config
In the docker-compose.yaml
```yaml
rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.9.11-management-alipine
